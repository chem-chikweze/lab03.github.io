      <p>
        Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Bonaparte;[1][b] 15 August 1769 – 5
        May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French
        military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during
        the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the
        Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French Republic as First
        Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the
        French from 1804 until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. Napoleon's
        political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and controversial
        leader. He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted through
        the years, and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in
        history. His campaigns are still studied at military academies
        worldwide. Between three and six million soldiers and civilians died in
        the Napoleonic Wars.[2][3]

      <p>
        Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica to a native family descending
        from Italian nobility.[4][5] Napoleon was resentful of the French
        monarchy, and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in
        the French army, even going so far as to try and spread its ideals to
        his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the
        governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he
        began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian
        allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two
        years later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a
        springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799
        and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and
        expand his power, he crowned himself <em>Emperor of the French</em>.

        Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal
        reforms to the lands he conquered in Europe, especially the regions of
        the Low Countries, Switzerland, modern Italy and Germany. He implemented
        many liberal policies in France and Western Europe.[c] Napoleon also
        sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803, instantly
        doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] His role in the Haitian
        Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France's overseas
        colonies are controversial and affect his reputation.[14]

      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>
        Napoleon's family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the
        Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family that emigrated
        to Corsica in the 16th century and his maternal ancestors, the
        Ramolinos, descended from a minor Genoese noble family.[15] His parents
        Carlo Maria Bonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino maintained an ancestral
        home called "Casa Bonaparte", known nowadays as Maison Bonaparte, in
        Ajaccio. Napoleon was born there on 15 August 1769. He was the family's
        fourth child and third son.[d] He had an elder brother, Joseph, and
        younger siblings Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme.
        Napoleon was baptised as a Catholic, under the name Napoleone.[16] In
        his youth, his name was also spelled as Nabulione, Nabulio, Napolionne,
        and Napulione.
      </p>
      <p>
        Napoleon was born one year after the Republic of Genoa ceded Corsica to
        France.[18] The state sold sovereign rights a year before his birth and
        the island was conquered by France during the year of his birth. It was
        formally incorporated as a province in 1770, after 500 years under
        Genoese rule and 14 years of independence.[e] Napoleon's parents joined
        the Corsican resistance and fought against the French to maintain
        independence, even when Maria was pregnant with him. His father Carlo
        was an attorney who had supported and actively collaborated with patriot
        Pasquale Paoli during the Corsican war of independence against
        France;[5] after the Corsican defeat at Ponte Novu in 1769 and Paoli's
        exile in Britain, Carlo began working for the new French government and
        in 1777 was named representative of the island to the court of Louis
        XVI.[5][22]
      </p>
      <p>
        The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose
        firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.[22] Later in life,
        Napoleon said, "The future destiny of the child is always the work of
        the mother."[23] His maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss
        Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal
        Joseph Fesch, fulfilled a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for
        some years. Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded
        him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical
        Corsican of the time.[24] Statue of Bonaparte as a schoolboy in Brienne,
        aged 15, by Louis Rochet [fr] (1853) When he turned 9 years old,[25][26]
        he moved to the French mainland and enrolled at a religious school in
        Autun in January 1779. In May, he transferred with a scholarship to a
        military academy at Brienne-le-Château.[27] In his youth he was an
        outspoken Corsican nationalist and supported the state's independence
        from France.[25][28] Like many Corsicans, Napoleon spoke and read
        Corsican (as his mother tongue) and Italian (as the official language of
        Corsica).[29][30][31][28] He began learning French in school at the age
        of around 10.[32] Although he became fluent in French, he spoke with a
        distinctive Corsican accent and never learned to spell in French.[33]
        Consequently, Napoleon was routinely bullied by his peers for his
        accent, birthplace, short stature, mannerisms, and inability to speak
        French quickly.[30] He became reserved and melancholy, applying himself
        to reading. An examiner observed that Napoleon "has always been
        distinguished for his application in mathematics. He is fairly well
        acquainted with history and geography ... This boy would make an
        excellent sailor".

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>
        Historians emphasize the strength of the <strong>ambition</strong> that
        took Napoleon from an obscure village to rule over most of
        Europe.[278][page needed] In-depth academic studies about his early life
        conclude that up until age 2, he had a "gentle disposition".[30] His
        older brother, Joseph, frequently received their mother's attention
        which made Napoleon more assertive and approval-driven. During his early
        schooling years, he would be harshly bullied by classmates for his
        Corsican identity and limited command of the French language. To
        withstand the stress he became domineering, eventually developing an
        inferiority complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        George F. E. Rudé stresses his "rare combination of will, intellect and
        physical vigour".[279] In one-on-one situations he typically had a
        hypnotic effect on people, seemingly bending the strongest leaders to
        his will.[280] He understood military technology, but was not an
        innovator in that regard.[281] He was an innovator in using the
        financial, bureaucratic, and diplomatic resources of France. He could
        rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates,
        keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future
        point, and like a chess master, "seeing" the best plays moves
        ahead.[282] This intellectual vigour was accompanied by a mixture of
        "remarkable charisma and willpower" and "a furious temper" exhibited
        during failure of his plans; which commanded respect as well as dread
        from his adjutants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Napoleon maintained strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing what
        needed to be done. He cheated at cards but repaid the losses; he had to
        win at everything he attempted.[284] He kept relays of staff and
        secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine
        history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a
        similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of
        luck; Napoleon responded, "Give me lucky generals", as he believed "luck
        comes to those who recognize opportunity, and seize it".[285] Dwyer
        states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06
        heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain
        of his destiny and invincibility.[286] "I am of the race that founds
        empires", he once boasted, deeming himself an heir to the Ancient
        Romans.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of influence on events, it was more than Napoleon's personality
        that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and
        money needed for wars.[288] He inspired his men—the Duke of Wellington
        said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he
        inspired confidence from privates to field marshals.[289] The force of
        his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought
        with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.
